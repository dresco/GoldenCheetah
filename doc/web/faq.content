<b><i>GoldenCheetah doesn't find my PowerTap on Ubuntu Linux.</i></b>
<p>
If you're using the USB cradle (as opposed to the older, serial one), 
the FTDI driver sometimes conflicts with the braille terminal in the
default Ubuntu installation.  Try unplugging the PT cradle from the
computer and uninstalling <code>brltty</code>:
<blockquote>
<code>sudo apt-get remove brltty</code>
</blockquote>
Then plug the device back in and it should work.

<b><i>I downloaded a .dmg, opened it, dragged and dropped GoldenCheetah into
Applications, double-clicked on it, and nothing happened.  What
gives?</i></b>

<p>
Are you running OS X Tiger (10.4) or later?  You need to be.
If you are, and you're still
having this problem, open Terminal (in Applications -&gt; Utilities) and type
this at the prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
/Applications/GoldenCheetah.app/Contents/MacOS/GoldenCheetah
</pre></blockquote>

then press &lt;return&gt; and send an email to the mailing list with
whatever it prints out.  We'll help you debug it.
